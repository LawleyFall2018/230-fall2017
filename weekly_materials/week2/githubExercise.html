            <div class="page-desc">
                <p>In today’s exercise, you’ll work with two different repositories on GitHub to perform tasks that are commonly done by web developers. Version control with Git can be a hard concept to wrap your head around at first, so exercise will be much easier if you've done the readings for today.</p>

                <p>The exercise assumes that you're using VS Code as your editor. If you're using Brackets, you can use chapters 5-6 of the <a href="http://practicalseries.com/1002-vcs/index.html#js--000000">Practical Series Git &amp; GitHub book</a> as a guide.</p>

                <p>Because you'll be working with private repositories that I've created, you need to be added to the 230-students team for the repository--that's why we asked you to provide your github username last week. If you haven't done so, you'll need to talk to Liz or one of the TAs to get access before you start the exercise. You’ll also need the ability to create private repositories, which is why I had you apply for the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">student developer pack</a> last week.</p>

                <p>In the first part of the exercise, you’ll make a fork (your own copy) of a repository that you don’t have write (push) permissions on, add a file in your copy of the repository, and then request that your new file be added into the the original repository. This is called a "pull request," and it's typically how you will add files to a repository that someone else controls (like open source software, or an industry project with a large team contributing to it). It gives the owner of the repository a chance to review and approve your changes before merging them into the codebase.</p>

                <p>In the second part of the exercise, you will have write (push) access to a shared repository--which is more likely to happen if you’re in a small workgroup without a single person approving all updates to the code--like a group project here at RIT. You’ll be editing the same file that the rest of the class is editing, which means there’s the potential for conflicts if you don’t follow the instructions carefully!</p>

                <p>Because this is a long exercise with a lot of screenshots, I've kept it as a PDF rather than converting it to an HTML file.</p>
